hi there i dont know if this will help you at all but if it helps even one person thats enough bit of back ground information i am year old that has been suffering from severe depression the past year with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour i felt like i was already dead cause one seemed to notice and i was slowly wasting away from the inside out i also began to hear voices that would constantly berate and tell to kill myself and after this i sought help from my gp and was put onto antidepressants sertraline which did absolutely nothing they didnt make it worse but they certainly didnt make it better i was then put onto another antidepressant mirtazapine which i started taking at the beginning of february which seemed to help i had the energy to finally get out of bed take shower and leave the house but couple of weeks ago i noticed that although i had the energy to get up and go about my daily life i was still thinking about killing myself everyday but this time it was different i had the energy and motivation to actually come up with detailed plan and go through with it and this scared so much i have never felt an urge to kill myself much i have in the last couple of weeks so yesterday i had lot to deal with my partner has been very sick with an unknown illness nearly year so his parents rushed him to hospital i was an absolute mess i have been really struggling to silence the suicidal thoughts whilst also fulfilling my duty carer my partner i had mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital the voices wouldnt stop i actually began shouting back at them but after few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor i became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan i grabbed my supplies which involved dog lead but i had made sure to buy this one especially this occasion it perfectly fit around my neck and had sturdy metal clip which i could attach to the banister which would hold my weight i was ready to it i was ready to go and i put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck i heard this would only take minute or so to make unconscious and the whole time i was holding my dog close to my chest cause i was so scared but i wanted to die so badly i could feel myself going i stopped and i dont know what stopped but part of thought that it wasnt my time to go so i ended up picking up the phone and calling someone who managed to calm down and helped look at everything from different perspective i know lot of people will say that its selfish feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to familyfriends etc but from what i felt yesterday none of that mattered i truly believed that i wanted to die and if i hadnt have stopped myself when i had i would probably be dead now but this morning my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill i am currently sat in the hospital waiting him to come out of surgery and i have been told by the doctors that he is going to live very healthy normal life after this operation if i had have killed myself yesterday afternoon i would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay i would never get to marry him in april i would never get to see him healthy and happy again all of these things i would have never known if i was dead now i can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again and i can try and enjoy mine much i can knowing that he will be around long time what im trying to get at after my long ass story is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto whether thats friend pet something youve got planned in the near future or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin anything to get you through each day you never have know when your life could take turn the best or if something amazing will happen and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now im not here to say that you shouldnt it because at the end of the day im just some stranger on the internet that you dont know but what i know is that things can always get better always but you never know when and youll never know if youre not here,1,1,0.56904805

ones really gonna read this but yeah im years old and got diagnosed with depression when i was i strongly dislike talking about my negative feelings partially because of trauma partially because im afraid people will look at differently when i finally did open up about it it didnt really go well and got immediately dragged to doctor to see whats wrong with im afraid to open up again once i got into therapy literally before the second appointment i send the therapist an email saying i feel much better now and dont need therapy because i thought it wouldnt work i know bottling up my emotions isnt healthy but its all ive been doing my entire life i sometimes talk about it online but thats all and even then i just feel awkward and like burden to the people that have to listen to i got held back last year because i didnt feel like going which is what i told everyone when i couldnt get out of bed and tried really hard to not kill myself i had my second suicide attempt that year i didnt want to tell anyone like my teachers friends or trusted ones because people know happy bubbly dumb and annoying or something like that anyway i feel like fucking failure i thought my mindset would change over time but it never did this year im doing tiny bit better im less absent but im still not doing great at school its not really that its hard i just dont have any motivation at all i always thought i wouldnt make it past or would just end up killing myself anyways so whats the point but i want to stay alive some of my family and friends so suicide isnt an option anymore what will i know i want to live but i have motivation at all its like everythings just big joke i know i should care but i dont does anyone have any advice,1,0,0.42601672

ive learned that life is fucking sad sometimes you start to think that maybe things arent going to get better at all ive been at points which i think it cant get worse than this but then i discover new section of rock bottom thinking ah this is it i assure you theres always something worse than what youre going through it can get worse per that same logic theres always the chance it gets better i think i hold onto that and you should too you might have realised at some point people in your life leave they come and go and the only constant in your life is you you have your back and thats what matters at the end of the day keeping this in mind take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible we humans are social creatures so having this emotional connection can literally save you it saved at least im sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now but know that you have power to improve it at this point things can either improve or worsen and the amazing this is that you have the choice,0,0,0.49763057

my bedroom and bathroom look like hurricane struck them and i cant even eat normally if at all i can barely move thats not an exaggeration just doing simple tasks feels like agony i havent selfharmed in almost year yet i feel like relapsing i just want to give myself alcohol poisoning or jump off of bridge over an interstate i feel like burden on my fiance i know he loves and that hes concerned but he has his own problems and im only adding to his i dont recognize myself anymore i dont know who the fuck i am i dread the future watching my boomer parents suffer from addiction depression and loneliness and struggle to afford retirement doesnt give high hopes i despise the fucking world i want part of any of this cruel selfish violent disgusting place i dont have the energy to partake in this rat race just to survive if youve read this far thanks taking the time sometimes all someone needs is to vent and not hold back their real thoughts and feelings,1,1,0.6098039
